    I'm Sebastián, and I've been professionally involved in the fullstack development world for over 6 years.
    I've worked with a variety of technologies, cloud services, and business models.
    I'm a deeply analytical and observant person—I like to understand the how and why behind everything.
    I believe real value lies in attention to detail and finding the logic behind each challenge.
